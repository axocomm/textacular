Requirements
------------
All Java libraries are located in the lib/ directory and are automatically included by `make'.

This program (for now) requires a Unix-based operating system, a modern LaTeX distribution (I use TeX Live 2013) and the Perl script latexmk. Unfortunately, I did not come across any other way to compile LaTeX from Java.
This script is usually included with TeX Live (and MacTeX). Due to the inability to really consider all possible configurations, the compile script located at res/bin/compile will look for in /usr/bin/latexmk and /usr/texbin/latexmk. Please update this file with the correct location of latexmk if it is somewhere else.

Compilation
-----------
You may use the included Makefile to compile and run this program if you are running from the command line. Otherwise, create a project in Eclipse at this location and add the JAR files inside lib/ to the project build path.

Notes
-----
Output from latexmk and other status messages will be printed to the console. If something goes horribly wrong and an error message does not appear, the console will likely say something.
